Project Description

This project delves into HR data to uncover key insights about employee demographics, turnover, and trends over time. We aim to answer critical questions about workforce composition, employment duration, and the factors that influence employee retention.

Key Questions Addressed

What is the gender breakdown of employees?
What is the race breakdown of employees?
What is the age distribution of employees?
How many employees work at HQ vs. remote?
What is the average length of employment for terminated employees?
How does gender distribution vary across departments and job titles?
What is the distribution of job titles across the company?
Which department has the highest turnover/termination rate?
What is the distribution of employees across locations (state and city)?
How has the company's employee count changed over time based on hire and termination dates?
What is the tenure distribution for each department?
